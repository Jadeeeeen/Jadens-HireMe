        <h2>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h2>

        <p>Well I'm hoping somewhere cool, and that pays a lot. I see myself in my own apartment with good money, and that's quite early, at least thats what im told, but I don't care.</p>

        <h2>What are three things you can't live without?</h2>
        <p>Well, my computer, my parents and probably my friends, those aren't all exactly things, only the computer is, but i'm just being honest</p>
        <h2>What is your favorite video game? </h2>

        <p>I have a hard time picking one single game, it would have to be either Forza Horizon 4, or Team Fortress 2, can't decide between the two though</p>

        <h2> Why are you in <span style="color:#ffaa7b"> Code Nation? </span></h2>

        <p> Well I want to learn how to code because I think its very interesting and helpful for a job but also I get internship opportunities </p>

        <h2> Bonus question! Do you like to code? Why?</h2>

        <p>When I first started coding, I hated it, it felt like I was doing useless things, at least for java script I did. I did like HTML and CSS though because I could be stupid website. When I started I had no idea what I was doing, or what language I was writing in, but now, I actually know a decent amount and am learning a lot. I pick up things pretty quickly and feel like im having fun making stupid or funny websites. Like the picture all the way at the top! </p>
